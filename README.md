# SwiftUI-Challenges

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift & SwiftUI with HackingWithSwift's 100 Days of SwiftUI

During the course challenges are given and in this repository i just put the ones where the challenge is "creating from scratch"

## Drawing

I chose to use a onTapGesture to capture the location where the gradient should have its origin. Just tap anywhere in the rectangle. The endPoint for the gradient will be set to the exact opposite location.
