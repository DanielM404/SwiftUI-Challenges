# SwiftUI-Challenges

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift & SwiftUI with HackingWithSwift's 100 Days of SwiftUI

During the course challenges are given and a selection of those are in here.
All projects are supposed to work on iPhone 12 Pro portrait only. No guarantee that it looks and behaves as intended on any other device.

## Drawing

I chose to use a onTapGesture to capture the location where the gradient should have its origin. Just tap anywhere in the rectangle. The endPoint for the gradient will be set to the exact opposite location.

## edutainment

Should be an app for kids to practice multiplications. Graphically, in the sense for an app for kids, there is still lot of room to improve.
